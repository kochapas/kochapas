    <p>
      Originally from Bangkok, Thailand. Currently living in Tokyo, Japan.
      Seeking to use my professional skills and experience to improve people's quality of life and promote workplace efficiency.
      I believe that one of the goals as a developer is to create something that makes people's life easier. If they have something to save them time, simplify their repetitive and complicated tasks, then they will also have more time to dedicate to something more meaningful as well, even just a time for more personal happiness is matter.
